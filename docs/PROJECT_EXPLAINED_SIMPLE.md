# 🏦 What Does This Project Do? 
### *A Simple Explanation for Everyone*

## 🤔 **The Big Question**

Imagine you have money in different countries - like dollars in America, euros in Europe, and yen in Japan. Sometimes, it costs different amounts to "rent" money (called interest) in each country. 

**Our big question is:** *"Should it cost the same to borrow money everywhere in the world, or are there good reasons why it might be different?"*

## 🌍 **What We're Studying**

### **1. Money Around the World** 💰
We look at **6 different types of money** (currencies):
- 🇺🇸 **US Dollars** (like what you use to buy things in America)
- 🇪🇺 **Euros** (what people use in many European countries)
- 🇬🇧 **British Pounds** (what they use in England)
- 🇯🇵 **Japanese Yen** (what they use in Japan)
- 🇨🇭 **Swiss Francs** (what they use in Switzerland)
- 🇸🇪 **Swedish Krona** (what they use in Sweden)

### **2. The "Cost of Borrowing Money"** 📈
When you want to borrow money, you have to pay extra money back - that's called **interest**. Different countries charge different interest rates.

### **3. Trading Money Between Countries** 🔄
People are always trading one type of money for another. Like trading your US dollars for euros when you visit Europe.

## 🎯 **What We Found Out**

### **The Main Discovery:** 
Sometimes it's more expensive to borrow money in one country than another, even when it should be about the same! This happens because:

1. 🏪 **Banks charge extra fees** (like when a store adds tax to your purchase)
2. 😟 **People get worried** about the economy and want to be extra careful
3. 📊 **Big events happen** (like when COVID started) that make people nervous about money

### **Our Special "Worry Meter"** 😰➡️😌
We built a special tool (called CISS) that measures how worried the whole financial world is:
- **😌 Green = Everyone is calm** (like a sunny day)
- **😐 Yellow = People are a little worried** (like cloudy weather)  
- **😰 Red = Everyone is very worried** (like a big storm!)

## 🔧 **How We Did This**

### **1. We Collected LOTS of Data** 📊

- **6,876+ data points** (imagine 6,876 puzzle pieces!)
- Information about money prices, interest rates, and how worried people were

### **2. We Built a Computer Program** 💻
Think of it like building a really smart robot that can:
- Read thousands of numbers really fast
- Find patterns that humans might miss
- Make graphs and charts to show what's happening
- Answer questions about money instantly

### **3. We Made a Website** 🌐
We created a special website where people can:
- Ask questions about money in different countries
- Get answers immediately 
- See colorful charts and graphs
- Learn about financial "weather" around the world

## 🎓 **What We Learned**

### **Big Lesson #1: Money is Connected** 🔗
When something happens in one country, it affects money all around the world. It's like when you drop a stone in a pond - the ripples spread everywhere!

### **Big Lesson #2: People's Feelings Matter** 💭
Sometimes money prices change not because of math, but because people get scared or excited. Our "worry meter" helps track these feelings.

### **Big Lesson #3: Patterns Repeat** 🔄
While every crisis is different, they often follow similar patterns. By studying the past, we can better understand the present.

### **Big Lesson #4: Technology Helps** 💻
With modern computers, we can analyze more information faster than ever before, helping us make better decisions about money.
